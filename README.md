Manage with a single image
Lifecycle Manager enables you to have all hosts in a cluster inherit the same image, thus removing variability between hosts. Using a single image means faster upgrades, improved reliability and easier overall maintenance.

 For the list of host requirements to be managed with a single image, please refer to the vSphere Lifecycle Manager product documentation.
